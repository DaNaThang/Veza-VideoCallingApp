Video calling App made on flutter - dart using Agora RTC and Firebase for Android Devices.







The new flutter version couldn't support firestore. I tried a lot of ways to fix it but I couldn't. For this reason I had to build the app with an old flutter version and had to clone an older project and add my coding files to it due to which there might me some insignificant internal/hidden files in my github repo. Apart from that the App works exactly the same way as it would in newer versions of flutter.
